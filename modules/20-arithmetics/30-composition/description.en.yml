  What if you need to solve something like this: `3 * 5 - 2`?

  ```php
  <?php

  print_r(3 * 5 - 2);
  ```

  Another exmaple:

  ```php
  <?php

  print_r(2 * 4 * 5 * 10);
  ```

  As you see, operations can be connected. This allows us to solve ever more complex expressions. To understand what happens inside the interpreter during the calculation, let's take a look at this example: `2 * 4 * 5 * 10`.

  1. First, `2 * 4` is calculated, which leads to this expression: `8 * 5 * 10`.
  1. Then `8 * 5`. We get to `40 * 10`.
  3. In the end the last multiplication is done, and we get the result: `400`.

instructions: |

  Write a program that calculates the result of `8 / 2 + 5 - -3 / 2`. Do not calculate anything by hand, all the calculations must be done by your code.

  Note that the interpreter does the calculations in the correct order: division and multiplication first, only then addition and substraction. Sometimes we need to modify this order, and we'll talk about the ways to do it later.
