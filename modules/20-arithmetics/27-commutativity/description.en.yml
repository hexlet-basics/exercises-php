name: Commutative operation
theory: |

  We learn this in grade one: two plus three is the same as three plus two. This is one of the basic laws of arithmetics that we know intuitively. It's called a **commutative property** of an operation.

  A binary operation is commutative if changing the order of operands doesn't affect the outcome. Obviously, addition is commutative: `3 + 2 = 2 + 3`.

  Is subtraction commutative? Of course not: `2 - 3 â‰  3 - 2`. Operators in programming follow the same rules.

  Actually, most of the operations you'll use aren't commutative. So make you pay attention to the order of operands.

instructions: |

  Write a program, that calculates and prints to screen results of the following mathematical expressions: "3 to the power of 5" and "-8 divided by -4".

  The results will be displayed together, on a single line without any spaces between them. We'll learn how to fix this problem later.
