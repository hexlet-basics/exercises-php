name: Operators
theory: |

  Let's learn some important terms before moving forwards. An operation sign like `+` is called an **operator**. It's just a symbol that produces a certain operation. Later you'll learn that there are other operators in PHP, than just arithmetic ones.

  ```php
  <?php

  print_r(8 + 2);
  ```

  In this example `+` is an **operator**, and numbers `8` and `2` are **operands**.

  In case of addition there're two operands: one on the left, one on the right from `+`. Operators that require two operands are called **binary**. If you skip at least one operand, like so `3 + ;`, the program will exit with an error.

  _There are also unary operations (with one operand) and even ternary (with three operands)!_

  Symbols _+_ and _-_ are used not only as operators. As far as negative numbers are concerned, the minus sign becomes part of the number:

  ```php
  <?php

  print_r(-3); // => -3
  // The same as 4 - 3
  print_r(4 + -3); // => 1
  ```

  The plus sign can work in the same way:

  ```php
  <?php

  print_r(+3); // => 3
  print_r(1 + +3); // => 4
  ```

  Write a program that calculates the difference between `6` and `-81`, and prints the result to screen.
