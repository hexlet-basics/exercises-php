name: Extracting characters from string
theory: |

  Sometimes we need to get one character from a string. For example, if a website stores user's name and last name, and at some moment we need to display this infomation in the abbreviated format, like `A. Ivanov`, we would need to extract the first character of the user's name.

  ```php
  <?php

  $firstName = 'Alexander';

  print_r($firstName[0]); // => A
  ```

  The square braces with a number in it - is a special operator used to extract a character from a string. The number inside is called an **index** or an **offset** - the character position inside the string. In almost all programming languages, the index numeration starts from 0. Therefore, we can access the first character by referring to it with the `0` index.

  PHP also supports negative string offsets. In that case, we refer to characters from the end of the string. `-1` is the index of the last character, `-2` is refers to the second last character and so on. Unlike the zero-based forward offsets, in case of inverted offset the first character's index  is  `-1`.

  ```php
  <?php

  $firstName = 'Alexander';

  print_r($firstName[-1]); // => r
  ```

  An index can be represented not only by a number, but also by a variable value. The following example will produce the same result - the output of the character `A`, even though it's index inside the square brackets is specified by a variable, rather than a specific number.

  ```php
  <?php

  $firstName = 'Alexander';
  $index = 0;

  print_r($firstName[$index]); // => A
  ```

instructions: |

  You have three variables with last names of three different persons. Combine the characters and print them to screen in the following order:

  1. the third character from the first string;
  2. the second character from the second string;
  3. the forth character from the third string;
  4. the fifth character from the second string;
  5. the third character from the second string.

  Try using interpolation: in addition to usual variables, you can put inside curly braces variables with an index in square brackets that refers to a separate character
