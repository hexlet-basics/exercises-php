name: Variable errors
theory: |

  The main rule is that a variable must be declared before the code where it is used. If you do it after, the program simply won't work.

  ```php
  <?php

  print_r($greeting);
  $greeting = 'Father!';
  ```

  Execution of the program above will exit with error _PHP Notice:  Undefined variable: greeting_. _Undefined variable_ is a reference error, it means that the code uses a name (identificator) that is not defined. And the error output points us to the exact place where the error occured: _greeting_. Other possible mistakes include trivial typos that may occur when a variable is used or declared.
  You can reduce the number of similar errors by using a correctly set editor. Such editor highlights names used without being previously declared and warns you of possible problems.

  Find an undeclared variable in the program and declare it with the value 'Dragon';
