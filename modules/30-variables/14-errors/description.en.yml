name: Variable errors
theory: |

  The main rule is that a variable must be declared before the code where it is used. If you do it after, the program simply won't work.

  ```php
  <?php

  print_r($greeting);
  $greeting = 'Father!';
  ```

  Execution of the program above will exit with error _PHP Notice:  Undefined variable: greeting_. _Undefined variable_ is a reference error, it means that the code uses a name (identificator) that is not defined. And the error ouput points us to the error: _greeting_. Other possible mistakes include trivial typos, at the times when we use a variable or when we declare it.

  You can reduce the number of similar errors by using a correctly set editor. Such editor highlights names used without being previously declared and warns you of possible problems.
