name: Comments
theory: |
  Almost all the programming languages allow you to add comments to your code. Comments are read only by humans - the interpreter doesn't evaluate them. Comments serve as notes for those who wrote them and other developers. There are two types of comments in php:

  **Single line comments** start with `//`. Whatever follows after will not be evaluated or executed.

  A comment can take up the whole line:

  ```php
  <?php

  // For Winterfell!
  ```

  or can follow some code on the same line:

  ```php
  <?php

  print_r('I am the King'); // => For Lannisters!
  ```

  **Multiline comments** start with `/*` and end with `*/`. Each line between them should start with a `*`.

  ```php
  <?php

  /*
   * The night is dark and
   * full of terrors.
   */
  print_r('I am the King');
  ```

instructions: |
  Create a single line comment with the folowing text: `You know nothing, Jon Snow!`.
