name: Instructions
theory: |

  Instruction is a command given to computer. PHP code is a set of instructions separated by `;`.

  Here is an example of code with two instructions. When you run this code you will see two sentences on the screen, one after the other.

  ```php
  <?php

  print_r('Mother of Dragons');
  print_r('Dracarys!');
  ```

  Actually, it's possible to put multiple instructions on the same line:

  ```php
  <?php

  print_r('Mother of Dragons'); print_r('Drakarys!');
  ```

  but it's considered bad practice.

  Output these three names on the screen, one after the other: "Robert", "Stannis", "Renly".
