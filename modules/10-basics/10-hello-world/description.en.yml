name: Hello, World!
theory: |
  It's a long-lasting tradition: our first program will be called "Hello, World!". Copy the code precisely from the instructions into the editor and Run it. Notice: case matters! Uppercase characters and lowercase characters are not the same. Remember to notice this in future.

instructions: |
  Type the following into the editor:

  ```php
  <?php
  print_r('Hello, World!');
  ```

tips:
  - "If there are `// BEGIN` and `// END` words in the editor, then write your code between those lines."
